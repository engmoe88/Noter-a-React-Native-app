# Noter-a-React-Native-app
A native react app that works on both ios and android. It simulates a note app that lets the user to add and remove notes to/from the app.
to run the app:
1- download expo (it's an app that lets you run your local native react apps on your own phone without having to install any simulators)
2- cd into the project after you have cloned it to your machine 
3- run npm start
4- the browser will launch with a barcode for you to scan, go ahead and scan it using your phone and it will prompt you to open expo
5- open it in expo and you will see your work live in front of your eyes ;)
NOTE: You NEED to connect your phone to the same wifi network your computer is running on when using expo. 

Thanks!
